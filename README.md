# Quark

Quark lets you define and implement rich (micro)service APIs that work with
your existing application frameworks. Quark lets you:

* Rapidly prototype and iterate service APIs
* Build service APIs with rich protocol semantics
* Support multiple programming languages and application frameworks

In addition to developing and implementing APIs, Quark also offers a packaging
service for each of its component languages, allowing easy distribution and
advertising of service availability to potential users. Quark also generates
API documentation for your libraries in standard formats for each language
(when they exist) including Javadoc for Java and Sphinx for Python.

##Rapid Prototyping

Quark is designed to rapidly prototype and iterate service APIs. In a typical
use case, the service developer writes both the server component and a client
library allowing other applications (or services) to use their service. With
Quark, the client component can be written quickly and much of the specifics
of how calls are processed is abstracted away from the client. This allows for
rapid iteration of APIs with many service changes requiring little or no
modifications to the calls themselves or the code written by users of the
service to access it. Just update the service and the client libraries within
user applications and it all works seamlessly.

### Example

The Datawire Directory service allows client applications to obtain and store
data within complex data structures from a central source, replicating the
data with an eventual consistency model. Clients can subscribe to get
notifications when data is updated or added to the central directory; the
directory pushes the new or modified data to subscribers asynchronously in an
eventual consistency model. The service author can iterate on the protocol
without changing the application interface presented by the Quark-generated
client libraries. In other words, client authors can take advantage of new
enhancements to the Quark API without changing any of the client code -- they
just need to update the library.

##Rich Semantics

Quark supports request/response and event-driven programming models. It also
supports many modern features including idempotency, RPC, flow controls,
timeouts, and one-way asynchronous processing.

###Example

Examples of many of the features Quark supports can be found in the
[Quark Examples repository](https://github.com/datawire/quark/tree/master/examples).

## Multiple Language and Framework Support

Quark lets you write once and generate working code in multiple output
languages. Because the same Quark code can be easily generated into multiple
languages, each service developer can choose their language of choice without
worrying about whether they'll be able to talk to each other - a service
primarily using Java can easily handle requests from applications or services
built in Python or Javascript. Further, instead of just publishing their API
contract and forcing the developers in each language to figure out how to
implement code around the specified rules, services built with Quark can
generate a client library native to each supported language to be directly
included in the services wishing to use it. Using the accompanying generated
documentation those client developers can quickly start communicating with a
minimal level of effort or need to learn new languages or tooling.

### Example

The Slack service includes a real-time API for processing messages
(https://api.slack.com/rtm). Quark lets the service author easily create and
maintain clients for the API. By defining the API using Quark, the service
author can quickly produce clients in multiple languages that interface
directly with this API.

## Installation and Configuration

This section provides an overview of the prerequisites, installation, and
compilation process for Quark meant to get you started. Some features and
target output languages have additional requirements. For full installation
and documentation instructions, see the
[Quark Installation and Configuration Guide](http://datawire.github.io/quark/install/index.html).

### Prerequisites

Quark requires a modern Linux distribution or Mac OS X. It has been
successfully tested on the following:

* Mac OS 10.10 (Yosemite)
* Mac OS 10.11 (El Capitain)
* Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)
* Fedora 22

Quark also requires the following:

* Python 2.7+
* pip
* a local git installation (to access the code base)

### Installation

To install Quark, do the following:

1. Pull the quark repository from GitHub using the following command:

        git clone https://github.com/datawire/quark.git

2. Run the following command from the top-level quark directory:

        python setup.py develop
        mvn install               # installs java quark runtime

### Compiling Quark Files

The Quark compiler can perform four distinct functions: generating code in one
or more target languages, compiling and running the generated code, generating
HTML documentation based on annotations in the code, and generating
distribution packages for one or more target languages.

The simplest command generates code in all supported target languages in
default output directories. It is:

`quark compile <files>`

where <files> is a space-separated list of the Quark files to compile.

This will output code in a subdirectory of your base quark directory (given
the name of the first file in the <files> list) and put generated Java,
Javascript, and Python code in java, js, and py subdirectories.

## Quark Language Basics

Quark is a Turing-complete language designed primarily for facilitating
microservice communication pathways although it is not limited to this
function.

Quark uses many of the standard elements of object-oriented programming
languages including packages, interfaces, classes, methods, properties,
functions, variables, annotations, operators, and keywords. It includes
inheritance, method and operator overloading, and property and method
overriding capabilities.

Quark may be used to write libraries or applications. Applications must
contain a single top-level main() function containing the executions structure
for the application; this function may reference code from any defined class
or package within the application.

Quark code is stored in text files with a .q file extension.

See the
[Quark Language Reference](http://datawire.github.io/quark/language-reference/index.html)
for more specifics about language structure and language elements.

## Next Steps

[Quark Installation and Configuration Guide](http://datawire.github.io/quark/install/index.html)
for more detailed information about installation, configuration, compilation,
packaging, and documentation generation.

The
[Quark Language Reference](http://datawire.github.io/quark/language-reference/index.html)
provides information about how to code in Quark and specifics about individual
language elements including keywords, operators, functions, data types, and
annotations.

The
[Quark Examples repository](https://github.com/datawire/quark/tree/master/examples)
(located in the examples subdirectory of the quark github repository) includes
a wide variety of examples illustrating both simple language features and full
end-to-end service implementations.

The [Quark Issues list](https://github.com/datawire/quark/issues) provides a
list of known issues - please feel free to add new issues or feature requests
as you start to use Quark.
