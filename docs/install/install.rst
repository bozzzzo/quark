Installation
============

This document walks you through the system, application, and tooling requirements for using Quark as well as the actual installation process. 

Prerequisites
-------------

Quark has basic requirements that all users must meet as well as
requirements specific to particular output languages.

Basic Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quark requires a modern Linux distribution or Mac OS X. It has been successfully tested on the following:

* Mac OS 10.10 (Yosemite)
* Mac OS 10.11 (El Capitain)
* Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)
* Fedora 22

Quark also requires the following:

* Python 2.7+
* pip
* tar


Java Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must have Java installed to use any Java code generated by Quark. Quark has been successfully tested with Java 7 and Java 8.

To compile and run the generated code directly from Quark you must also have Maven installed. Quark has been successfully tested with Maven 3.1 and Maven 3.3.x. Maven is not required if you wish to use the generated .java files manually either directly or within an IDE.

To use the documentation or package generation feature of Quark with Java, you must also have Maven installed. Quark has been successfully tested with Maven 3.1 and Maven 3.3.x.

Note: Javadoc comments will be generated in the source files as part of the code generation process. You may manually run Javadoc on those files to generate HTML documentation without Maven installed.

Python Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no additional requirements to use Python code generated by
Quark. The code you write that uses quark-generated code will need to
depend on a quark runtime package. Currently there is only
quark-core-twisted runtime package that itself depends on twisted.

If you are running this on Ubuntu ensure that you have the
'python-dev' and 'build-essential' packages installed. ``sudo apt-get
install python-dev build-essential`` or the installation of twisted
will fail.



Javascript Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must have Node.js installed to use any Javascript code generated by Quark. Quark has been successfully tested with Node 4.2.1 and is expected to work with any 4.x version of Node. If your system comes with an older version of node consult instructions from the `Node project <https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/>`_.

Installation
------------

To install Quark, run the following command:

``pip install --user datawire-quark``

make sure you have `~/.local/bin` in your PATH:

``type -P quark && echo quark found, OK || (echo "You need to update your PATH in your shell startup script" && echo 'PATH="$PATH":~/.local/bin')``

you may also consider installing quark inside a virtualenv.
